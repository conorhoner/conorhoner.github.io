REMOTE is an interactive short film where viewers use their phones to decide the protagonist Lexi's actions, shaping the narrative's direction and presenting the user with different dialogue and outcomes. The primary screen (the film) serves as the central storytelling medium, while the secondary screen (a mobile device) acts as an interface for real-time decision-making. This approach allows us to explore themes of agency, privacy, and control through storytelling in Lexi’s dystopian environment.
The use of a second screen enhances interactivity by making the audience co-authors and active participants of the story. As they choose between narrative pathways, such as confronting or investigating an AI glitch, they feel responsible for the outcomes. This aligns with Jenkins’ (2006) Convergence Culture, which highlights how participatory media blurs the lines between creators and consumers. By using mobile devices for decision-making, we aim to deepen engagement, immersion, and emotional connection to the story which will be user tested by survey and a comparative prototype/ demo. Through this project, we hope to contribute to the growing field of interactive media and second screen experiences, demonstrating their potential to revolutionise storytelling and capture audiences.
